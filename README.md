Data from the Linked ATM project by Gossa Lo

African Traditional Medicine (ATM) is widely used in Africa as the first-line of treatment thanks to its accessibility and affordability. However, the lack of formalization of this knowledge can lead to safety issues and malpractice. We investigate a possible contribution of the Semantic Web in realizing the formalization and integration of ATM with data on conventional medicine. As a proof of concept we convert various ATM datasets and link them to conventional medical data. This results in a Linked ATM knowledge graph.
